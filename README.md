        Attendance management is important to every single organization; it will only decide
whether an organization will be successful in the future. Organizations must keep a track of
people under them such as employees and students to maximize their performance. Managing
student attendance during lecture periods has become a difficult challenge. The ability to
compute the attendance percentage is a major task as manual computation produces errors, and
wastes a lot of time. For the stated reason efficient application is designed. In this application,
the records of the studentâ€™s attendance are uploaded to the local server once the attendance roll
call is done. Recording absent in a department which is having a large number of students in a
classroom is a difficult task and time-consuming. Moreover, the process takes much time, and
many efforts are spent by the staffs to complete the attendance rates for each student. The
process of recording attendances for students was in the form of hardcopy and it requires human
power. Besides wasting time and taking efforts for preparing sheets and documents, it will cause
damage to the sheets and sometimes it could be stolen. Another feature is to send remainder to
faculties regarding their lecture hours at respective classrooms and displaying the absentees on
faculty timetable by clicking the respective hours. Thus, it mainly focuses on reducing the
manual work of lecturers. Once the absentees had been marked it will be uploaded to the website
and the clerk can check the absentees of every class via the website. This reduces the burden of
the clerk by collecting the attendance from every class, and also the number of students who skip
their classes can be identified.
